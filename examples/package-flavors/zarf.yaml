  This example demonstrates how to define variants of packages within the same package definition.  This can be combined with [Composable Packages](/ref/examples/composable-packages/) to build up packages and include the necessary [merge overrides](/ref/components/#merge-strategies) for each variant.

  Given package flavors are built by specifying the `--flavor` flag on `zarf package create`.  This will include any components that match that flavor or that do not specify a flavor.  If a component specifies a flavor and the package is built without that flavor, the component will be excluded from the package.
