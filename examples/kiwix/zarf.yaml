  This example shows Zarf's ability to inject data into a container running in a pod, in this case to initialize a [Kiwix server](https://www.kiwix.org/en/) to allow offline viewing of documentation and wiki pages.

  Data injections allow for data that is not included in the container image to be injected at deploy time and are declared using the `dataInjections` key within a component.  Once the specified container is started, Zarf will copy the files and folders from the specified source into the specified container and path.

  :::caution

  Data injections depend on the `tar` (and for `compress`, `gzip`) executables and their implementation across operating systems.  Between macOS and Linux there is general agreement on how these utilities should function, however on Windows you may see issues enabling compression.

  To resolve this you can either disable compression or use the GNU core-utils version of `tar` and `gzip`.
