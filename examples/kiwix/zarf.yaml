  This example shows how to save data during package create so that it can be loaded into a container running in a pod, in this case to initialize a [Kiwix server](https://www.kiwix.org/en/) to allow offline viewing of documentation and wiki pages.

  By saving the Kiwix data to a container image, we can spin up an init container that will copy the data to the main container running Kiwix.
