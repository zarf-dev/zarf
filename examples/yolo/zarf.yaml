  This example demonstrates YOLO mode, an optional mode for using Zarf in a fully connected environment where users can bring their own external container registry and Git server.

  ## Prerequisites

  - A running K8s cluster. (The cluster does not need to have the Zarf init package installed or any other Zarf-related bootstrapping.)

  ## Instructions

  Create the package:

  ```bash
  zarf package create examples/yolo
  ```

  ### Deploy the package

  ```bash
  # Run the following command to deploy the created package to the cluster
  zarf package deploy

  # Choose the yolo package from the list
  ? Choose or type the package file [tab for suggestions]
  > zarf-package-yolo-<ARCH>.tar.zst

  # Confirm the deployment
  ? Deploy this Zarf package? (y/N)

  # Wait a few seconds for the cluster to deploy the package; you should
  # see the following output when the package has been finished deploying:
    Connect Command    | Description
    zarf connect doom  | Play doom!!!
    zarf connect games | Play some old dos games 🦄

  # Run the specified `zarf connect <game>` command to connect to the deployed
  # workload (ie. kill some demons). Note that the typical Zarf registry,
  # Gitea server and Zarf agent pods are not present in the cluster. This means
  # that the game's container image was pulled directly from the public registry and the URL was not mutated by Zarf.
  ```
