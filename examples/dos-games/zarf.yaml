  This example provides the basis for Zarf's [Retro Arcade](/tutorials/3-deploy-a-retro-arcade) tutorial.  It deploys a Dos Games arcade into the cluster and provides an easy way to connect and play games.

  :::note

  In this example, there is no requirement for a "GitOps" service; Zarf is only showing off its ability to act as a standard means of packaging, distribution, and deployment runtime.
