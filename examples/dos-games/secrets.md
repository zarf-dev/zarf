level 1 secrets:
  1. In the corridor at the end of the zigzag room, a portion of the west wall is colored differently and has a corpse lying next to it (G). Activate the wall to gain access to the courtyard with the blue armor (sector 68).
  2. After having entered the dark room with the exit door, return to the zigzag room. The platform with the Imp(s) has now been lowered, yielding access to a secret room (H) containing a shotgun (sector 69).
  3. After opening secret #2, walk toward the north end of the zigzag room. As you cross the shadow line (I), a lift will lower in the shotgun alcove (J), visible from where you are standing. Run and you can catch it before it goes up. At the end of the hallway is a fake see-through wall, the first such wall in the game (sector 70).
