  As you can see in the example, the `import` key can be combined with other keys to merge components together.  This can be done as many components deep as you wish and in the end will generate one main `zarf.yaml` file with all of the defined resources included.

  This is useful if you want to slightly tweak a given component while maintaining a common core.
