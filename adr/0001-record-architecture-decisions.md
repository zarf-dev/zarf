> This file was automatically created when we used [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to initialize the document log in the repo. ADRs on ADRs are a little silly, but it does give a lightweight way to direct the reader over to our contributor guide that has a lot more information.

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), with a couple of small tweaks. See the [Documentation section in the Contributor guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md#documentation) for full details.

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).
