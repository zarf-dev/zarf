## zarf tools helm rollback

roll back a release to a previous revision

### Synopsis


This command rolls back a release to a previous revision.

The first argument of the rollback command is the name of a release, and the
second is a revision (version) number. If this argument is omitted or set to
0, it will roll back to the previous release.

To see revision numbers, run 'helm history RELEASE'.


```
zarf tools helm rollback <RELEASE> [REVISION] [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --cleanup-on-fail               allow deletion of new resources created in this rollback when rollback fails
      --dry-run string[="unset"]      simulates the operation without persisting changes. Must be one of: "none" (default), "client", or "server". '--dry-run=none' executes the operation normally and persists changes (no simulation). '--dry-run=client' simulates the operation client-side only and avoids cluster connections. '--dry-run=server' simulates the operation on the server, requiring cluster connectivity.
      --force-conflicts               if set server-side apply will force changes against conflicts
      --force-replace                 force resource updates by replacement
  -h, --help                          help for rollback
      --history-max int               limit the maximum number of revisions saved per release. Use 0 for no limit (default 10)
      --no-hooks                      prevent hooks from running during rollback
      --server-side string            must be "true", "false" or "auto". Object updates run in the server instead of the client ("auto" defaults the value from the previous chart release's method)
      --timeout duration              time to wait for any individual Kubernetes operation (like Jobs for hooks) (default 5m0s)
      --wait WaitStrategy[=watcher]   if specified, will wait until all resources are in the expected state before marking the operation as successful. It will wait for as long as --timeout. Valid inputs are 'watcher' and 'legacy' (default hookOnly)
      --wait-for-jobs                 if set and --wait enabled, will wait until all Jobs have been completed before marking the release as successful. It will wait for as long as --timeout
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --burst-limit int                 client-side default throttling limit (default 100)
      --color string                    use colored output (never, auto, always)
      --colour string                   use colored output (never, auto, always)
      --content-cache string            path to the directory containing cached content (e.g. charts)
      --debug                           enable verbose output
      --features stringToString         [ALPHA] Provide a comma-separated list of feature names to bools to enable or disable. Ex. --features "foo=true,bar=false,baz=true" (default [])
      --insecure-skip-tls-verify        Skip checking server's certificate for validity. This flag should only be used if you have a specific reason and accept the reduced security posture.
      --kube-apiserver string           the address and the port for the Kubernetes API server
      --kube-as-group stringArray       group to impersonate for the operation, this flag can be repeated to specify multiple groups.
      --kube-as-user string             username to impersonate for the operation
      --kube-ca-file string             the certificate authority file for the Kubernetes API server connection
      --kube-context string             name of the kubeconfig context to use
      --kube-insecure-skip-tls-verify   if true, the Kubernetes API server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
      --kube-tls-server-name string     server name to use for Kubernetes API server certificate validation. If it is not provided, the hostname used to contact the server is used
      --kube-token string               bearer token used for authentication
      --kubeconfig string               path to the kubeconfig file

      --plain-http                      Force the connections over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This flag should only be used if you have a specific reason and accept the reduced security posture.
      --qps float32                     queries per second used when communicating with the Kubernetes API, not including bursting
      --registry-config string          path to the registry config file
      --repository-cache string         path to the directory containing cached repository indexes
      --repository-config string        path to the file containing repository names and URLs
