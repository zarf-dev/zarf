## zarf tools registry version

Print the version

### Synopsis

The version string is completely dependent on how the binary was built, so you should not depend on the version format. It may change without notice.

This could be an arbitrary string, if specified via -ldflags.
This could also be the go module version, if built with go modules (often "(devel)").

```
zarf tools registry version [flags]
```

### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for version
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --allow-nondistributable-artifacts   Allow pushing non-distributable (foreign) layers
      --insecure                           Allow image references to be fetched without TLS
      --insecure-skip-tls-verify           Skip checking server's certificate for validity. This flag should only be used if you have a specific reason and accept the reduced security posture.

      --plain-http                         Force the connections over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This flag should only be used if you have a specific reason and accept the reduced security posture.
      --platform string                    Specifies the platform in the form os/arch[/variant][:osversion] (e.g. linux/amd64). (default "all")
  -v, --verbose                            Enable debug logs
```
