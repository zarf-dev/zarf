## zarf tools helm dependency

manage a chart's dependencies

### Synopsis


Manage the dependencies of a chart.

Helm charts store their dependencies in 'charts/'. For chart developers, it is
often easier to manage dependencies in 'Chart.yaml' which declares all
dependencies.

The dependency commands operate on that file, making it easy to synchronize
between the desired dependencies and the actual dependencies stored in the
'charts/' directory.

For example, this Chart.yaml declares two dependencies:

    # Chart.yaml
    dependencies:
    - name: nginx
      version: "1.2.3"
      repository: "https://example.com/charts"
    - name: memcached
      version: "3.2.1"
      repository: "https://another.example.com/charts"


The 'name' should be the name of a chart, where that name must match the name
in that chart's 'Chart.yaml' file.

The 'version' field should contain a semantic version or version range.

The 'repository' URL should point to a Chart Repository. Helm expects that by
appending '/index.yaml' to the URL, it should be able to retrieve the chart
repository's index. Note: 'repository' can be an alias. The alias must start
with 'alias:' or '@'.

Starting from 2.2.0, repository can be defined as the path to the directory of
the dependency charts stored locally. The path should start with a prefix of
"file://". For example,

    # Chart.yaml
    dependencies:
    - name: nginx
      version: "1.2.3"
      repository: "file://../dependency_chart/nginx"

If the dependency chart is retrieved locally, it is not required to have the
repository added to helm by "helm add repo". Version matching is also supported
for this case.


### Options

```
  -h, --help   help for dependency
```

### Options inherited from parent commands

```
      --burst-limit int                 client-side default throttling limit (default 100)
      --debug                           enable verbose output
      --insecure-skip-tls-verify        Skip checking server's certificate for validity. This flag should only be used if you have a specific reason and accept the reduced security posture.
      --kube-apiserver string           the address and the port for the Kubernetes API server
      --kube-as-group stringArray       group to impersonate for the operation, this flag can be repeated to specify multiple groups.
      --kube-as-user string             username to impersonate for the operation
      --kube-ca-file string             the certificate authority file for the Kubernetes API server connection
      --kube-context string             name of the kubeconfig context to use
      --kube-insecure-skip-tls-verify   if true, the Kubernetes API server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
      --kube-tls-server-name string     server name to use for Kubernetes API server certificate validation. If it is not provided, the hostname used to contact the server is used
      --kube-token string               bearer token used for authentication
      --kubeconfig string               path to the kubeconfig file
  -n, --namespace string                namespace scope for this request
      --plain-http                      Force the connections over HTTP instead of HTTPS. This flag should only be used if you have a specific reason and accept the reduced security posture.
      --qps float32                     queries per second used when communicating with the Kubernetes API, not including bursting
      --registry-config string          path to the registry config file
      --repository-cache string         path to the file containing cached repository indexes
      --repository-config string        path to the file containing repository names and URLs
```
