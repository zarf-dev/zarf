## zarf package deploy

### Synopsis

```

```

```

      --components string           Comma-separated list of components to deploy.  Adding this flag will skip the prompts for selected components.  Globbing component names with '*' and deselecting 'default' components with a leading '-' are also supported.
      --confirm                     Confirms package deployment without prompting. ONLY use with packages you trust. Skips prompts to review SBOM, configure variables, select optional components and review potential breaking changes.
