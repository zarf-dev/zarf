## zarf tools helm uninstall

uninstall a release

### Synopsis


This command takes a release name and uninstalls the release.

It removes all of the resources associated with the last release of the chart
as well as the release history, freeing it up for future use.

Use the '--dry-run' flag to see which releases will be uninstalled without actually
uninstalling them.


```
zarf tools helm uninstall RELEASE_NAME [...] [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --cascade string                Must be "background", "orphan", or "foreground". Selects the deletion cascading strategy for the dependents. Defaults to background.
      --description string            add a custom description
      --dry-run                       simulate a uninstall
  -h, --help                          help for uninstall
      --ignore-not-found              Treat "release not found" as a successful uninstall
      --keep-history                  remove all associated resources and mark the release as deleted, but retain the release history
      --no-hooks                      prevent hooks from running during uninstallation
      --timeout duration              time to wait for any individual Kubernetes operation (like Jobs for hooks) (default 5m0s)
      --wait WaitStrategy[=watcher]   if specified, will wait until all resources are in the expected state before marking the operation as successful. It will wait for as long as --timeout. Valid inputs are 'watcher' and 'legacy' (default hookOnly)
```
