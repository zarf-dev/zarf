## Introduction

In this tutorial, we will sign a Zarf package and verify its signature to ensure package integrity and authenticity. We'll generate a key pair, sign a package during creation, verify the signature, and deploy the signed package.

Package signing is a critical security practice, allowing you to verify that packages have not been tampered with and come from a trusted source.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning this tutorial you will need the following:

- Zarf binary installed on your $PATH: ([Installing Zarf](/getting-started/install/))
- The Zarf source code repository for creating the wordpress example package.

:::note

For a comprehensive reference on signing methods, signature formats, and advanced use cases, see the [Package Signing Reference](/ref/package-signing/).

:::

## Step 1: Clone the Zarf repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf.git
```

Do not change your working directory to the Zarf directory for the next steps.

## Step 2: Generate a Signing Key Pair

First, we'll generate a private/public key pair for signing packages:

```bash
zarf tools gen-key
```

You'll be prompted to enter a password to encrypt the private key. Choose a strong password and remember it.

This creates two files:
- `cosign.key` - Your private signing key (keep this secure!)
- `cosign.pub` - Your public verification key (share this with others)

:::caution

Keep your private key secure and never commit it to version control. Anyone with access to your private key can sign packages as you.

:::

## Step 3: Create a Package

Now we'll create a wordpress package from the Zarf examples directory:

```bash
zarf package create ./zarf/examples/wordpress
```

The path to the created package will be present in the logs:
```
INF writing package to disk path=zarf-package-wordpress-arm64-26.0.0.tar.zst
```

## Step 4: Sign the Package

To sign the package, we'll now use the key pair created earlier:

```bash
zarf package sign zarf-package-wordpress-arm64-26.0.0.tar.zst --signing-key cosign.key --signing-key-password <password>
```

Your package (for example, `zarf-package-wordpress-amd64-26.0.0.tar.zst`) now contains a digital signature.

## Step 5: Verify the Package Signature

Let's verify that our package signature is valid using the public key:

```bash
zarf package verify zarf-package-wordpress-amd64-26.0.0.tar.zst --key cosign.pub
```

You should see successful verification output:

```
2026-01-15 14:17:13 INF checksum verification status=PASSED
Verified OK
2026-01-15 14:17:16 INF signature verification status=PASSED
2026-01-15 14:17:16 INF verification complete status=SUCCESS
```

Notice that verification checks both the signature and the package checksums. This confirms the package is authentic and has not been modified.

## Step 6: Deploy with Signature Verification

Finally, we'll deploy the package with signature verification enabled. If you have a Kubernetes cluster initialized (see [Initializing a K8s Cluster](/tutorials/1-initializing-a-k8s-cluster/)), you can deploy:

```bash
zarf package deploy zarf-package-wordpress-amd64-26.0.0.tar.zst --key cosign.pub --verify --confirm
```

The `--verify` flag enforces signature verification. If the signature is invalid or the public key doesn't match, Zarf will abort the deployment.

You should see the package being verified before deployment begins:

```
Verifying package signature...
✔ Package signature verified successfully
Deploying package...
```

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics of package signing, you can:

- Learn about signing existing packages with `zarf package sign` in the [Package Signing Reference](/ref/package-signing/)
- Explore cloud KMS options for production signing in the [Package Signing Reference](/ref/package-signing/#cloud-key-management-services-kms)
- Integrate signature verification into your CI/CD pipelines
- Establish key management and rotation procedures for your organization
