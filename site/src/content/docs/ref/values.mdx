Deploy time values are used throughout the Zarf deployment process to template `manifests` and `files`, set Helm values, or provide environment variables for `actions`, and can be provided by the `zarf package deploy` user, the `zarf package create` user, or internally by Zarf itself.

## Using Values

### Value Templates

Values can be templated into `manifests`, `files`, and `charts` using a unique `###ZARF_VAR_<VALUE_KEY>###` syntax anywhere in the file, where `<VALUE_KEY>` is the name of the value along with any associated prefix in ALL_CAPS (see [Setting Values](#setting-values) below). This allows you to punch through other templating engines to place values precisely where you want in a given file.  You can also control how this templating happens when defining a value such as with the `autoIndent` key on `constants` and `variables`.  A simple value template for a [Zarf Variable](#variables-zarf_var_) named `DATABASE_USERNAME` would look like the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: db-configmap
data:
  username: ###ZARF_VAR_DATABASE_USERNAME###
```

:::note

Helm [chart hooks](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts_hooks/) are not templated by Zarf

:::

### Helm Chart Mapping

[Zarf Variables](#variables-zarf_var_) can also be mapped directly to Helm values within a given `charts` definition.  This is done with the `variables` key within a chart that allows you to take a Zarf Variable `name` and map it to a YAML path within that chart's Helm values.  This chart's Helm value will then be set to the current value of the Zarf Variable at the time of it's installation.

```yaml
    charts:
      - name: wordpress
        version: 16.0.4
        namespace: wordpress
        localPath: chart
        variables:
          - name: DATABASE_USERNAME
            path: db.username
```

<Properties item="ZarfChartVariable" />

:::caution

Chart `variables` in Zarf are currently an `alpha` feature and may be subject to change in later versions of Zarf.

:::

### Environment Variables

Zarf `actions` can also pull values from the shell's environment when running a `cmd`.  These values are available under the same `ZARF_<VALUE_KEY>` as value templates (without any `#`s) and can be used like the below:

```yaml
    actions:
      onDeploy:
        after:
          - cmd: echo ${ZARF_VAR_DATABASE_USERNAME}
```

## Setting Values

:::note

All value `name` fields must match the regex pattern `^[A-Z0-9_]+$` ([Test](https://regex101.com/r/BG5ZqW/1)).

:::

### Variables (`ZARF_VAR_`)

Variables are dynamic values that are set by the `zarf package deploy` user or internally by the outputs of `actions`.  When used they are prefixed with `ZARF_VAR`, and they can be defined with the top-level `variables` key for input by the user:

```yaml
variables:
  name: DATABASE_USERNAME
  description: 'The username for the database'
```

<Properties item="InteractiveVariable" unwrap={["Variable"]} />

Or can be set within an `actions` `setVariables` key to take the value from the standard output of the given `cmd`:

```yaml
components:
  - name: set-variable-example
    actions:
      onDeploy:
        after:
          - cmd: echo "username-value"
            setVariables:
              - name: DATABASE_USERNAME
```

<Properties item="Variable" />

:::note

Variables with `type: file` will be set to the filepath when used in `actions` (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables) above) due to constraints on the size of environment variables in the shell.  This also allows for additional processing of the file by its filename.

:::

:::tip


For user-specified variables, you can specify a `default` value for the variable to take in case a user does not provide one on deploy, and can specify whether to `prompt` the user for the variable when not using the `--confirm` or `--set` flags.

```yaml
variables:
  name: DATABASE_USERNAME
  default: 'postgres'
  prompt: true
```

When not specifying `default`, `prompt`, `sensitive`, `autoIndent`, or `type` Zarf will default to `default: ""`, `prompt: false`, `sensitive: false`, `autoIndent: false`, and `type: "raw"`

:::

### Constants (`ZARF_CONST_`)

Constants are static values that are set by the `zarf package create` user and are used as a way to bake in a common value that the package creator would like to template or use within the deployment process.  They are useful to centralize the setting of resources that will be baked into the package (such as image references) to have a singular place to update potentially many downstream references.  They are set with a top-level `constants` key as in the below:

```yaml
constants:
  name: DATABASE_USERNAME
  description: 'The username for the database'
  value: 'postgres'
```

<Properties item="Constant" />


### Internal Values (`ZARF_`)

In addition to user supplied Variables, and Constants, Zarf maintains a list of internal variables that components can use for more advanced functionality (such as within [`init` packages](/ref/init-package)).  Below are the current values Zarf supports:

- `STORAGE_CLASS`: Storage class specified for persistent storage within the Kubernetes cluster (maps to `--storage-class` on `zarf init`)
- `REGISTRY`: Address of the registry server used during `zarf init` (maps to `--registry-url` on `zarf init`)
- `NODEPORT`: Nodeport used for a registry internal to the cluster (maps to `--nodeport` on `zarf init`)
- `REGISTRY_AUTH_PUSH`: Password for pushing images to the registry (maps to `--registry-push-password` on `zarf init`)
- `REGISTRY_AUTH_PULL`: Password for pulling images from the registry (maps to `--registry-pull-password` on `zarf init`)
- `GIT_PUSH`: Username utilized for pushing changes to the Git server (maps to `--git-push-username` on `zarf init`)
- `GIT_AUTH_PUSH`: Password required for pushing changes to the Git server (maps to `--git-push-password` on `zarf init`)
- `GIT_PULL`: Username employed for pulling changes from the Git server (maps to `--git-pull-username` on `zarf init`)
- `GIT_AUTH_PULL`: Password required for pulling changes from the Git server (maps to `--git-pull-password` on `zarf init`)
- `DATA_INJECTION_MARKER`: The marker used within a `dataInjection` target Pod `spec` that Zarf uses to track a data injection

:::note

Because files can be deployed without a Kubernetes cluster, some built-in values such as `###ZARF_REGISTRY###` may not be available if no previous component has required access to the cluster. If you need one of these built-in values, a prior component will need to have been called that requires access to the cluster, such as `images`, `repos`, `charts`, `manifests`, or `dataInjections`.
