Component Actions offer several exec entrypoints that allow a component to perform additional logic at key stages of its lifecycle. These actions are executed within a shell with the same context as the Zarf binary. For a detailed overview of the execution sequence of component actions, please refer to the Zarf [package create lifecycle documentation](/ref/create/) and [package deploy lifecycle documentation](/ref/deploy/). Additionally, you can experiment with the component actions example located in the [Component Actions example](/ref/examples/component-actions/).

## Action Sets

The `component.actions` field includes the following optional keys, also known as `action sets`:

- `onCreate` - Runs during `zarf package create`.
- `onDeploy` - Runs during `zarf package deploy`.
- `onRemove` - Runs during `zarf package remove`.

### Action Set Lists

These `action sets` contain optional `action lists`. The `onSuccess` and `onFailure` action lists are conditional and rely on the success or failure of previous actions within the same component, as well as the component"s lifecycle stages.

- `before` - sequential list of actions that will run before this component is processed for `create`, `deploy`, or `remove`.
- `after` - sequential list of actions that will run after this component is successfully processed for `create`, `deploy`, or `remove`.
- `onSuccess` - sequential list of actions that will run after **ALL** `after` actions have successfully completed.
- `onFailure` - sequential list of actions that will run after **ANY** error during the above actions or component operations.

### Action Set Defaults

In addition to `action lists`, `action sets` can also specify a `defaults` section that will be applied to all actions in the set. The `defaults` section contains all of the same elements as an action configuration, with the exception of the action specific keys like `cmd`, `description` or `wait`, which are not allowed in the `defaults` section.

## Action Configurations

An `action list` contains an ordered set of `action configurations` that specify what a particular action will do.  In Zarf there are two action types (`cmd` and `wait`), the configuration of which is described below.

### Common Action Configuration Keys

Between all action configurations, there are a few common keys that are common to all of them which are described below:

- `description` - a description of the action that will replace the default text displayed to the user when the action is running. For example: `description: "File to be created"` would display `Waiting for "File to be created"` instead of `Waiting for "touch test-create-before.txt"`.
- `maxTotalSeconds` - the maximum total time to allow the command to run (default: `0` - no limit for command actions, `300` - 5 minutes for wait actions).

### `cmd` Action Configuration

A `cmd` action executes arbitrary commands or scripts within a shell wrapper. You can use the `cmd` key to define the command(s) to run. This can also be a multi-line script. _You cannot use `cmd` and `wait` in the same action_.

Within each of the `action` lists (`before`, `after`, `onSuccess`, and `onFailure`), the following action configurations are available:

- `cmd` - (required if not a wait action) the command to run.
- `dir` - the directory to run the command in, defaults to the current working directory.
- `mute` - whether to mute the realtime output of the command, output is always shown at the end on failure (default: `false`).
- `maxRetries` - the maximum number of times to retry the command if it fails (default: `0` - no retries).
- `env` - an array of environment variables to set for the command in the form of `name=value`.
- `setVariables` - set the standard output of the command to a list of variables that can be used in other actions or components (onDeploy only).
- `shell` - set a preferred shell for the command to run in for a particular operating system (default is `sh` for macOS/Linux and `powershell` for Windows).

:::note

By default, multi-line `cmd` blocks will fail if one of the lines errors out; this is analogous to setting `set -e` in a shell script, as documented in the [GNU bash docs](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html).

:::

:::note

Any binaries you execute in your `cmd` actions must exist on the machine they are executed on.  You can bring binaries with a Zarf Package as `files` with the `executable` key set, or take advantage of the `./zarf `&nbsp;transformation as described in [action transformations](#action-transformations).

:::

### `wait` Action Configuration

The `wait` action temporarily halts the component stage it is initiated in, either until the specified condition is satisfied or until the maxTotalSeconds time limit is exceeded (which, by default, is set to 5 minutes). To define `wait` parameters, execute the `wait` key; it is essential to note that _you cannot use `cmd` and `wait` in the same action_. Essentially, a `wait` action is _yaml sugar_ for a call to `./zarf tools wait-for`.

Within each of the `action` lists (`before`, `after`, `onSuccess`, and `onFailure`), the following action configurations are available:

- `wait` - (required if not a cmd action) the wait parameters.
  - `cluster` - perform a wait operation on a Kubernetes resource (kubectl wait).
    - `kind` - the kind of resource to wait for (required).
    - `name` - the name of the resource to wait for (required), can be a name or label selector.
    - `namespace` - the namespace of the resource to wait for.
    - `condition` - the condition to wait for (default: `exists`).
  - `network` - perform a wait operation on a network resource (curl).
    - `protocol` - the protocol to use (i.e. `http`, `https`, `tcp`).
    - `address` - the address/port to wait for (required).
    - `code` - the HTTP status code to wait for if using `http` or `https`, or `success` to check for any 2xx response code (default: `success`).

## Action Examples

Below are some examples of putting together simple actions at various points in the Zarf lifecycle:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Simple onCreate">

Below is a simple example of an `onCreate` action set that declares `defaults` as well as `before` and `after` action lists:

<ExampleYAML
  src={import("../../../../../examples/component-actions/zarf.yaml?raw")}
  component="on-create"
/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Failure Handling onDeploy">

Below is an example of an `onDeploy` action set that demonstrates how you can use `onFailure` actions to perform cleanup tasks or user messaging when an action of component lifecycle step fails:

<ExampleYAML
  src={import("../../../../../examples/component-actions/zarf.yaml?raw")}
  component="on-deploy-with-timeout"
/>
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Wait for a Resource">

Below are examples of waiting for resources to exist or be available within an action using `wait` actions:

<ExampleYAML
  src={import("../../../../../examples/component-actions/zarf.yaml?raw")}
  component="on-create-with-network-wait-action"
/>
<ExampleYAML
  src={import("../../../../../examples/component-actions/zarf.yaml?raw")}
  component="on-deploy-with-wait-action"
  showLink={false}
/>
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Action Transformations

As you may have noticed mentioned in the `before` action list of the above `Simple onCreate` example, Zarf provides some helpful transformations that help enhance cross-platform compatibility and allow you to better orchestrate Zarf and its components.

Below are the transformations that Zarf will make on an action before it is ran:

- Replace `./zarf `&nbsp;with the path to the currently running Zarf executable.
  - This allows you to run Zarf in Zarf and is designed to help you use `zarf tools` commands in the air gap.
- Replace common Unix commands and shell syntax with `powershell` / `pwsh` alternatives on Windows.
  - This allows commands like `touch` to work on Windows and while not perfect enhances cross-platform capabilities.
- Add `env` entries for all previously declared Zarf `variables`.
  - This allows you to use variables in actions and when combined with `setVariables` allows you to chain `variables` from an action for use in later actions or templates.

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Variables onDeploy">

Within `onDeploy` action lists, you can use the `setVariables` action configuration to set a list of variables that can be used in other actions or components during `zarf package deploy`. The variable value will be assigned in two environment variables: `ZARF_VAR_{NAME}` and `TF_VAR_{name}`. These values will be accessible in subsequent actions and can be used for templating in `files` or `manifests` in other components as `###ZARF_VAR_{NAME}###`. This feature allows package authors to define dynamic runtime variables for consumption by other components or actions.

:::note

Unlike normal variables, `setVariables` do not need to be defined with the `variables` key at the top of the `zarf.yaml`.

:::

<ExampleYAML
  src={import("../../../../../examples/component-actions/zarf.yaml?raw")}
  component="on-deploy-with-multiple-variables"
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Zarf in Zarf onRemove">

Below is an example of an `onRemove` action set that demonstrates how you can use `./zarf `&nbsp;to use Zarf commands like `zarf tools kubectl` to perform actions on systems that might not have the pre-requisite software (like `kubectl`) installed onto them:

<ExampleYAML
  src={import("../../../../../examples/component-actions/zarf.yaml?raw")}
  component="on-remove"
/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Additional Action Use Cases

Below are a few more use cases from other `examples` and `packages` for how actions can be used:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Downloading Pre-requisites">

The below example shows the `kiwix-serve` component from the data injections example which downloads a `.zim` file with an `onCreate.before` action for inclusion into the Zarf package.

<ExampleYAML
  src={import("../../../../../examples/kiwix/zarf.yaml?raw")}
  component="kiwix-serve"
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Setting up Dependencies">

The below example includes the `eksctl` binary and `eks.yaml` file in one component, setting it up in an `onDeploy.after` action and then uses the `eksctl` binary in a second component to create an EKS cluster in an `onDeploy.before` action.

<ExampleYAML
  src={import("../../../../../packages/distros/eks/zarf.yaml?raw")}
  component="load-eksctl"
/>
<ExampleYAML
  src={import("../../../../../packages/distros/eks/zarf.yaml?raw")}
  component="deploy-eks-cluster"
  showLink={false}
/>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Waiting for GitOps Resources">

The below example shows using a `wait` command to wait for a GitOps deployment to happen after Zarf configures the initial `GitRepository` manifest.  By default Zarf will only track the resources it directly deploys, but adding a `wait` action allows you to control the lifecycle more directly.

<ExampleYAML
  src={import("../../../../../examples/podinfo-flux/zarf.yaml?raw")}
  component="podinfo-via-flux-git"
/>

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
