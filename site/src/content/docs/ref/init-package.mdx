In a traditional Kubernetes deployment, clusters pull resources (e.g. cluster images, OCI artifacts, Git repos) from external sources.

However, in an air-gapped environment, these external providers are not available, or exist at different locations to their references within Kubernetes manifests.

Zarf solves this problem with its 'init' package, a special Zarf Package (traditionally deployed first) that provides the necessary mechanisms to enable air-gapped Kubernetes, and deliver DevSecOps across air-gaps.

:::note[tldr;]

Don't care about the details and just want to get deploying as quickly as possible? Run the following after connecting to a cluster:

```bash
zarf tools download-init
zarf init --confirm
```

## Core Components

An 'init' package requires a series of specially named, and configured components to ensure the cluster is correctly initialized. These components are:

- [`zarf-injector`](#zarf-injector-and-zarf-seed-registry)
- [`zarf-seed-registry`](#zarf-injector-and-zarf-seed-registry)
- [`zarf-registry`](#zarf-registry)
- [`zarf-agent`](#zarf-agent)

### `zarf-injector` and `zarf-seed-registry`

One of the most challenging aspects of deploying into an air-gapped environment is the initial bootstrapping of the cluster.

A cluster needs a registry to pull images from, but spinning up a registry requires an image to be pulled from a registry - chicken, meet egg.

To ensure that our approach is distro-agnostic, the Zarf team developed a unique solution to seed the container registry into the cluster, populate said registry, and redirect cluster resources to use the air-gapped registry.

Shoving random data into a cluster is generally a bad idea, and an antipattern overall to containerization. However in the case of Zarf, and air-gapped environments, certain liberties must be taken.

While there is no distro-agnostic method to inject images into a cluster, every cluster has support for `configmaps`. However, the size of a `configmap` is limited to 1MB (technically only limited by whatever is configured in `etcd`, the default is 1MB), and the `registry:2` image is around 10MB (as of this writing). So we split the `registry:2` image into chunks and inject them into the cluster as `configmaps`.

But then we have another problem of how to reassemble the image on the other side, as we don't have any consistent image that exists in the cluster that would have such utilities. This is where the `zarf-injector` Rust binary comes in.

> For compiling the `zarf-injector` binary, refer to its [README.md](https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/tree/main/src/injector/README.md).

The `zarf-injector` binary is statically compiled and injected into the cluster as a `configmap` along with the chunks of the `registry:2` image. During the `zarf-seed-registry`'s deployment, the `zarf-injector` binary is run in a pod that mounts the `configmaps` and reassembles the `registry:2` image. It then hosts a temporary, pull-only Docker registry implemented in Rust so that a real registry can be deployed into the cluster from the hosted `registry:2` image.

> While the `zarf-injector` component *must* be defined and deployed *before* the `zarf-seed-registry` component, the magic doesn't start until `zarf-seed-registry` is deployed. The `zarf-injector` component for the most part just copies the `zarf-injector` binary to `###ZARF_TEMP###/zarf-injector`.

When `zarf init` deploys the `zarf-seed-registry` component, the following happens:

1. Zarf injects the `zarf-injector` binary and the `registry:2` image chunks into the cluster.
2. Zarf connects to the cluster and grabs a pod that is running an image that is already present in the cluster.
3. Zarf spins up a pod using the existing image, mounts the `configmaps` that contain the `zarf-injector` binary and the `registry:2` image chunks and runs the `zarf-injector` binary.

:::note

Doing this keeps Zarf cluster agnostic, however does require that the kubelet be able to reach out to a cluster NodePort service, which may require changes to firewall configurations like allowing UDP traffic between nodes if using something like VXLAN tunneling.

:::

4. The `zarf-injector` binary reassembles the `registry:2` image and hosts a temporary registry that the cluster can pull from.
5. The `docker-registry` chart in the `zarf-seed-registry` component is then deployed, with its `image.repository` set to the temporary registry that the `zarf-injector` binary is hosting (consumed as the `###ZARF_SEED_REGISTRY###` built-in variable set at runtime).
6. Once the `docker-registry` chart is deployed, the `zarf-seed-registry` component is marked as complete and the `zarf-injector` pod is removed from the cluster.
7. Deployment proceeds to the `zarf-registry` component.

:::note

The `registry:2` image and the Zarf Agent image can be configured with a custom init package using the `registry_image_*` and `agent_image_*` templates defined in the Zarf repo's [zarf-config.toml](https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/blob/main/zarf-config.toml).  This allows you to swap them for enterprise provided / hardened versions if desired such as those provided by [Iron Bank](https://repo1.dso.mil/dsop/opensource/defenseunicorns/zarf/zarf-agent).

:::

### `zarf-registry`

The `zarf-registry` component is a long-lived container registry service that is deployed into the cluster.

It leverages the same `docker-registry` chart used in `zarf-seed-registry` but with a few key differences:

1. The `image.repository` is set to the value of the built-in variable `###ZARF_REGISTRY###` which is set at runtime to the registry hosted by `zarf-seed-registry`.
{/* you know, why DO we do this? if we kept the repository the same, and kept running the injector, couldnt this handle cluster full-deaths??? (ofc would need to tweak the zarf-agent to not mutate the image.repository for the docker-registry chart under the zarf namespace, but i think it might be doable) */}
2. A `connect` manifest for running [`zarf connect registry`](/commands/zarf_connect/) to tunnel to the Zarf Registry.
3. A configmap to satisfy [KEP-1755](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-cluster-lifecycle/generic/1755-communicating-a-local-registry)

:::tip

You can further customize how the registry behaves by setting variables such as `REGISTRY_PVC_SIZE` with a [config file](/ref/config-files/) or `--set` on `zarf init`.

To see a full list of `variables` you can view the [`zarf.yaml` that defines the registry](https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/blob/main/packages/zarf-registry/zarf.yaml).

:::

#### Using External Registries

Zarf can be configured to use an already existing registry with the `--registry-*` flags when running [`zarf init`](/commands/zarf_init/).

This option skips the injector and seed process, and will not deploy a registry inside of the cluster. Instead, it pushes any images contained in the package to the externally configured registry.

:::note

Given the registry is a core part of any Kubernetes deployment you MUST either specify an external registry with the `--registry-*` flags or use the injected registry.

:::

#### Making the Registry Highly-Available

By default, the registry included in the init package creates a `ReadWriteOnce` PVC and is only scheduled to run on one node at a time.

This setup is usually enough for smaller and simpler deployments. However, for larger deployments or those where nodes are frequently restarted or updated, you may want to make the registry highly-available.

This approach requires certain prerequisites, such as a storage class that supports `ReadWriteMany`, or being in an environment that allows you to configure the registry to use an S3-compatible backend.

Additionally, you must provide custom configuration to the registry to ensure it is distributed across all nodes and has the appropriate number of replicas. Below is an example [configuration file](/ref/config-files/) using a ReadWriteMany storage class:

```yaml
# zarf-config.yaml
package:
  deploy:
    set:
      REGISTRY_PVC_ENABLED: "true"
      REGISTRY_PVC_ACCESS_MODE: "ReadWriteMany"
      REGISTRY_HPA_AUTO_SIZE: "true"
      REGISTRY_AFFINITY_CUSTOM: |
        podAntiAffinity:
          preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            - weight: 100
              podAffinityTerm:
                labelSelector:
                  matchExpressions:
                    - key: app
                      operator: In
                      values:
                        - docker-registry
                topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```

Notably, the `REGISTRY_AFFINITY_CUSTOM` variable overrides the default pod anti-affinity, and `REGISTRY_HPA_AUTO_SIZE` automatically adjusts the minimum and maximum replicas for the registry based on the number of nodes in the cluster. If you prefer to manually set the minimum and maximum replicas, you can use `REGISTRY_HPA_MIN` and `REGISTRY_HPA_MAX` to specify the desired values.

### `zarf-agent`

{/* TODO: document and flesh out how the mutations operate for the agent */}

The `zarf-agent` is a [Kubernetes Mutating Webhook](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook) that intercepts requests to create resources and uses the `zarf-state` secret to mutate them to point to their air-gapped equivalents.

The `zarf-agent` is responsible for modifying [Kubernetes PodSpec](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#PodSpec) objects [Image](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubernetes-api/workload-resources/pod-v1/#Container.Image) fields to point to the Zarf Registry. This allows the cluster to pull images from the Zarf Registry instead of the internet without having to modify the original image references.

The `zarf-agent` modifies the following [flux](https://fluxcd.io/flux/) resources: [GitRepository](https://fluxcd.io/docs/components/source/gitrepositories/), [OCIRepository](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/ocirepositories/), & [HelmRepository](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/source/helmrepositories/) to point to the local Git Server or Zarf Registry. HelmRepositories are only modified if the `type` key is set to `oci`.

> Support for mutating OCIRepository and HelmRepository objects is in [`alpha`](/roadmap#alpha) and should be tested on non-production clusters before being deployed to production clusters.

The `zarf-agent` modifies [ArgoCD applications](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/application-specification/) & [ArgoCD Repositories](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/private-repositories/)  objects to point to the local Git Server.

> Support for mutating `Application` and `Repository` objects in ArgoCD is in [`beta`](/roadmap#beta) and should be tested on non-production clusters before being deployed to production clusters.

:::note

During the [`zarf init`](/commands/zarf_init) operation, the Zarf Agent will add the `zarf.dev/agent: ignore` label to prevent the Agent from modifying any resources in that namespace. This is done because there is no way to guarantee the images used by pods in existing namespaces are available in the Zarf Registry.

If you would like to adopt pre-existing resources into a Zarf deployment you can use the `--adopt-existing-resources` flag on [`zarf package deploy`](/commands/zarf_package_deploy/) to adopt those resources into the Helm Releases that Zarf manages (including namespaces). This will add the requisite annotations and labels to those resources and drop the `zarf.dev/agent: ignore` label from any namespaces specified by those resources.

:::

#### Image Mutation to Unique Hashed Tags

When the agent mutates an image that is not pinned to a digest, it appends a [CRC32 hash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) to the tag. For example, if the original image is `ghcr.io/stefanprodan/podinfo:6.4.0` the mutated image tag will be `6.4.0-zarf-298505108`. The CRC32 hash `298505108` is generated using the original image name `ghcr.io/stefanprodan/podinfo`.

Without this unique hash, images from different registries with the same path—such as `docker.io/stefanprodan/podinfo:6.4.0`-would overwrite each other when pushed to the Zarf registry. Zarf pushes both the regular tag and the unique tag for non pinned images. This ensures no images are lost during a push, and the agent can always mutate to the correct image. To see which image a pod used before mutation, check the `zarf.dev/original-image-<container-name>` annotation.

Additionally, when Git repositories are pushed to the Zarf Git server their name is appended with a CRC32 hash to prevent similar collisions.

#### Excluding Resources from `zarf-agent`

Resources can be excluded at the namespace or resources level by adding the `zarf.dev/agent: ignore` label.

Zarf will refuse to adopt the Kubernetes [initial namespaces](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/#initial-namespaces) (`default`, `kube-*`, etc...). This is because these namespaces are critical to the operation of the cluster and should not be managed by Zarf.

Additionally, when adopting resources, ensure that the namespaces specified are dedicated to Zarf, or add the `zarf.dev/agent: ignore` label to any non-Zarf managed resources in those namespaces (and ensure that updates to those resources do not strip that label) otherwise [ImagePullBackOff](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#imagepullbackoff) errors may occur.

The Agent does not need to create any secrets in the cluster. Instead, during `zarf init` and `zarf package deploy`, secrets are automatically created in a [Helm Postrender Hook](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/advanced/#post-rendering) for any namespaces Zarf sees. If you have resources managed by [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/) that are not in a namespace managed by Zarf, you can either create the secrets manually or include a manifest to create the namespace in your package and let Zarf create the secrets for you.

## Optional Components

The Zarf team maintains some optional components in the default 'init' package.

| Components   | Description                                                                                                                                                       |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| k3s          | REQUIRES ROOT (not sudo). Installs a lightweight Kubernetes Cluster on the local host [K3s](https://k3s.io/) and configures it to start up on boot.   |
| git-server   | Adds a [GitOps](https://about.gitlab.com/topics/gitops/)-compatible source control service [Gitea](https://gitea.io/en-us/) into the cluster. |

There are two ways to deploy these optional components. First, you can provide a comma-separated list of components to the `--components` flag, such as `zarf init --components k3s,git-server --confirm`, or, you can choose to exclude the `--components` and `--confirm` flags and respond with a yes (`y`) or no (`n`) for each optional component when interactively prompted.

:::caution

(Linux only) Deploying the 'k3s' component will require `root` access (not just `sudo`), as it modifies your host machine to install the cluster and by default only provides access to the cluster to the `root` user.

:::

:::tip

The `k3s` component included differs from the default `k3s` install in that it disables the installation of `traefik` out of the box.  This was done so that people could more intentionally choose if they wanted `traefik` or another ingress provider (or no ingress at all) depending on their needs.  If you would like to return `k3s` to its defaults, you can set the `K3S_ARGS` Zarf variable to an empty string:

```text
root@machine ~ # zarf init --components k3s --set K3S_ARGS="" --confirm
```

:::

:::tip

You can further customize how the git-server behaves by setting variables such as `GIT_SERVER_PVC_SIZE` with a [config file](/ref/config-files/) or `--set` on `zarf init`.

To see a full list of `variables` you can view the [zarf.yaml that defines the git-server](https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/blob/main/packages/gitea/zarf.yaml).

:::

## Putting it All Together

The package definition 'init' is similar to writing any other Zarf Package, but with a few key differences:

Starting with `kind` and `metadata`:

```yaml {3, 6, 9}
# zarf.yaml
# kind must be ZarfInitConfig
kind: ZarfInitConfig
metadata:
  # name *can* be anything, but it is generally recommended to end with 'init'
  name: init
  # version should be empty as it will be set by the Zarf CLI
  # (this is ONLY for the 'init' package)
  # version: 0.1.0
...
```

In order for Zarf to operate correctly, the following `components`:

- must be defined, ordered, and named **exactly** as shown below
- must have the `required` field set to `true`

```yaml {3, 7, 11, 15}
# zarf.yaml
components:
  # components (like k3s) that spin up a cluster...

  - name: zarf-injector
    required: true
    ...

  - name: zarf-seed-registry
    required: true
    ...

  - name: zarf-registry
    required: true
    ...

  - name: zarf-agent
    required: true
    ...

  # optional components that need a cluster ...
```

:::note

In order to reproduce / build the following example, you will need to have the Zarf repository cloned locally.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf.git
cd zarf
mv zarf.yaml zarf.yaml.bak
```

You can learn more about creating a custom init package in the [Creating a Custom 'init' Package Tutorial](/tutorials/7-custom-init-packages).

:::

A minimal `zarf.yaml` for the 'init' package looks something like:

```yaml
# zarf.yaml
kind: ZarfInitConfig
metadata:
  name: init

components:
  - name: zarf-injector
    required: true
    import:
      path: packages/zarf-registry

  - name: zarf-seed-registry
    required: true
    import:
      path: packages/zarf-registry

  - name: zarf-registry
    required: true
    import:
      path: packages/zarf-registry

  - name: zarf-agent
    required: true
    import:
      path: packages/zarf-agent
```

{/* technically the most minimal you can go is just `zarf-agent` and using an external registry / git server but idk if it's worth documenting that */}
