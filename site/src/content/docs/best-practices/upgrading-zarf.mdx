title: "Upgrading Zarf"
---

TODO:
- Understand the zarf init process
- Fill in the TODO blanks for links and references
- Consider the issue regarding existing init and attempting to change registry/secret information

Optimally the version of Zarf performing the `package create` and `package deploy` operations aligns to the version of [Init Package]() that is installed within the cluster. 

Follow [CLI Installation](../../getting-started/install) ateps for installing updates to the version of binary installed. 

# Upgrading the Init Package

Upgrading the init package is a bit different from upgrading a regular application package because it establishes your cluster’s foundational infrastructure. Follow these steps to upgrade your init package:

## 1. Obtain the Updated Init Package

- **Default Package:** If you’re using the default package, run the following command to fetch the latest init package (if it’s not already present locally):

  ```bash
  zarf tools download-init
  ```

- **Validate:** This will download the associated init package to TODO: insert location - zarf cache?

- **Manual:** The Init Package can also be manually downloaded from the Github releases to a storage location of your choice.

  ```bash
  curl -LO <TODO insert an example version download>
  ```

## 2. Re-initialize the cluster

TODO: when do we recommend one over the other? Do we recommend standard package deploy at all? Look at command flags

- **Init:** The init process can be executed to upgrade a cluster from one version to another.

  ```bash
  zarf init --confirm
  ```

- **Deploy:** The Init Package can also be deployed directly with `package deploy` - allowing for explicit deployment specification.

```bash
zarf package deploy zarf-init-package....TODO --confirm
```

> :warning: **NOTE**: TODO note about the command required to update the registry information / secrets. 

## 3. Validate Zarf infrastructure

- **Validate:** Ensure the following zarf resources are healthy:
  - Registry if deployed
  - Agent pods

  ```bash
  zarf tools kubectl get pods -n zarf
  ```
