# Upgrading the Init Package

Upgrading the init package is a bit different from upgrading a regular application package because it establishes your cluster’s foundational infrastructure (like the internal registry, injector, and agent). Follow these steps to upgrade your init package:

## 1. Obtain the Updated Init Package

- **New Version:** When a new version of Zarf is released—or you’ve made improvements to your custom init package—you’ll generate (or download) a new init package tarball. It is typically named following the convention:  
  `zarf-init-<ARCH>-<VERSION>.tar.zst`.

- **Default Package:** If you’re using the default package, run the following command to fetch the latest init package (if it’s not already present locally):

  ```bash
  zarf tools download-init
