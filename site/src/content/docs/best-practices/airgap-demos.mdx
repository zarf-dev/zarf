title: "Offline Live Demos with Zarf"
---

Event Wi‚ÄëFi is unpredictable. DNS breaks, captive portals intervene, and even a tiny image pull can stall a talk. That‚Äôs why some events recommend avoiding live demos entirely.

Zarf takes the opposite stance: **live demos should be reliable**. Zarf packages everything your demo needs ‚Äî Helm charts, container images, manifests, and supporting assets ‚Äî into a single, portable file. You build the package ahead of time on a connected machine, then deploy it on stage with networking disabled. No public registries. No Helm repos. No ‚Äúhold on, it‚Äôs pulling an image.‚Äù

**What you‚Äôll learn**
- Construct a fully self‚Äëcontained Zarf package
- Prove a demo runs with zero external connectivity
- Reuse the same package for workshops, trainings, and airgapped environments

---

## Prerequisites
- A Kubernetes cluster you control (kind, k3d, k3s, minikube, or any conformant cluster)
- **Zarf** installed on your build machine *and* on the demo machine

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **One‚Äëtime cluster prep:** Zarf uses an internal registry and optional git service managed in‚Äëcluster. Run `zarf init` once per cluster before deploying packages (details below).

---

## What we‚Äôll build
We‚Äôll package the popular sample app **podinfo**. The result is a single file like `zarf-package-podinfo-demo-<version>-amd64.tar.zst`.

Before you take the stage, you'll:

- Ensure the cluster is running
-  (If not already done) `zarf init`

Once you take the stage:

- `zarf package deploy` the file ‚Äî **with Wi‚ÄëFi off**
- `zarf connect` to port-forward to any required UI services

---

## Phase 1 (Connected): Create the package
Create a working directory:

```bash
mkdir -p zarf-podinfo-demo && cd zarf-podinfo-demo
```

Create a `zarf.yaml` describing the package:

```yaml
# zarf.yaml
kind: ZarfPackageConfig
metadata:
  name: podinfo-demo
  description: Offline demo of podinfo packaged by Zarf
  version: 1.0.0
components:
  - name: podinfo
    description: Deploy podinfo via Helm, completely offline
    required: true
    charts:
      - name: podinfo
        version: 6.9.1
        namespace: demo
        releaseName: podinfo
        url: oci://ghcr.io/stefanprodan/charts/podinfo
        valuesFiles:
          - values.yaml
    # Explicitly list images so they are pulled into the package
    images:
      - ghcr.io/stefanprodan/podinfo:6.9.1
    manifests:
      - name: connect-service
        namespace: demo
        files:
          - connect-service.yaml
```

Create a minimal `values.yaml` to customize the demo:

```yaml
# values.yaml
replicaCount: 1
ui:
  message: "Hello from Zarf ‚Äî no internet required!"
```

Additionally we will create a separate service to enable `zarf connect` port-forwarding access

```yaml
#connect-service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: podinfo-connect
  labels:
    # Enables "zarf connect podinfo-demo"
    zarf.dev/connect-name: podinfo-demo
  annotations:
    zarf.dev/connect-description: "The podinfo UI service"
spec:
  selector:
    app.kubernetes.io/name: podinfo
  ports:
    - name: http
      port: 9898
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: 9898
```

> üí° The chart and image versions don‚Äôt have to match numerically, but **must** exist. Pin them to an exact version you‚Äôve tested to ensure reproducibility.

Identify the architecture you plan to deploy to on-stage. If you are building the package on a connected system that happens to be an `amd64` architecture but plan to use `arm64` you can pass `-a/--architecture` with the architecture you want the package to run on. 

Now create the package (this step downloads artifacts and embeds them):

```bash
zarf package create .
```

You should now have a file similar to:

```
zarf-package-podinfo-demo-amd64-1.0.0.tar.zst
```

Optionally verify what‚Äôs inside:

```bash
zarf package inspect definition zarf-package-podinfo-demo-amd64-1.0.0.tar.zst
```

Copy the package file to your demo laptop (USB, etc.) or optionally publish it to a public registry such as `ghcr.io`.

---

## Phase 2 (Once per cluster): Initialize Zarf
On the demo machine **with the target cluster running**, initialize Zarf. This installs the Zarf system components (including the internal registry) into the cluster so deployments can load packaged images without the public internet.

```bash
zarf tools download-init && zarf init --confirm
```

> ‚úÖ Do this only once per cluster. For fresh ephemeral clusters (kind/k3d/minikube), run it after the cluster is created.

---

## Phase 3 (Disconnected): Deploy the package
Turn off Wi‚ÄëFi to prove the point. Then deploy:

Prove that the cluster is empty:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A
```

```bash
zarf package deploy ./zarf-package-podinfo-demo-amd64-1.0.0.tar.zst --confirm
```

Watch the pods come up:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -w
```

When `podinfo` is `Running`, port‚Äëforward and open your browser: 

```bash
zarf connect podinfo-demo --local-port 9898
```

> Note: `--local-port` specifies the local port to bind to. If you forgo this flag a random port will be assigned.

This is the same as:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n demo svc/podinfo 9898:9898
```

Visit `http://localhost:9898` ‚Äî you should see the UI message from `values.yaml`.

---

## Live demo flow (suggested script)
1. **Show the package**: a single `.tar.zst` file on your desktop.
2. **Toggle airplane mode**: visibly disable networking.
3. **`zarf package deploy`**: audience can see images loading from the in‚Äëcluster registry.
4. **Port‚Äëforward & refresh**: open the app UI; call out the custom message.
5. **Q&A**: highlight that Helm and image pulls were satisfied locally; no external registries or repos were contacted.

---

## Cleanup
When you‚Äôre done:

Locate the package

```bash
zarf package list
```

Remove the package from the cluster

```bash
zarf package remove podinfo-demo --confirm
```

> If your talk uses a throwaway cluster, you can also delete the cluster entirely and skip `zarf package remove`.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Image not found during create**: double‚Äëcheck `images:` tags exist and are reachable from the build machine.
  - Ensure the image packaged (including the repository) is the exact reference used in the manifests/helm charts.
- **Chart fetch fails during create**: verify the OCI URL and chart `version`. Zarf vendors the chart into the package; it will not contact the chart repo at deploy time.
- **No pods after deploy**: did you run `zarf init` on this cluster? Run `zarf init --confirm` once, then redeploy.

---

## Reuse & extensions
- **Workshops:** Publish the package to a registry such as `ghcr.io` and/or a local network registry for offline retrieval.
- **Multiple apps:** add more components to the same `zarf.yaml` (each with charts/images) to build a single multi‚Äëapp demo package.

---

## Appendix A ‚Äî Offline readiness checklist
- [ ] `zarf package create` succeeds on a connected build machine
- [ ] `zarf package inspect` lists the expected images and the podinfo chart
- [ ] Package file copied to demo machine
- [ ] Demo cluster created and `zarf init --confirm` has been run once
- [ ] Optional: test deploy with Wi‚ÄëFi off ahead of the talk
