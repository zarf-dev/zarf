title: "Offline Live Demos with Zarf"
---

Event Wi‚ÄëFi is unpredictable. DNS breaks, captive portals intervene, and even a tiny image pull can stall a talk. That‚Äôs why some events recommend avoiding live demos entirely.

Zarf takes the opposite stance: **live demos should be reliable**. Zarf packages everything your demo needs‚ÄîHelm charts, container images, manifests, and supporting assets‚Äîinto a single, portable file. You build the package ahead of time on a connected machine, then deploy it on stage with networking disabled. No public registries. No Helm repos. No ‚Äúhold on, it‚Äôs pulling an image.‚Äù

**What you‚Äôll learn**
- Construct a fully self‚Äëcontained Zarf package
- Prove a demo runs with zero external connectivity
- Reuse the same package for workshops, trainings, and air‚Äëgapped environments

---

## Prerequisites
- A Kubernetes cluster you control (kind, k3d, k3s, minikube, MicroK8s, or any conformant cluster)
- **Zarf** installed on your build machine *and* on the demo machine
- Ability to copy files between machines (USB key, etc.)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **One‚Äëtime cluster prep:** Zarf uses an internal registry and optional git service managed in‚Äëcluster. Run `zarf init` once per cluster before deploying packages (details below).

---

## What we‚Äôll build
We‚Äôll package the popular sample app **podinfo**. The result is a single file like `zarf-package-podinfo-demo-<version>-amd64.tar.zst` that you can copy to your demo laptop. On stage, you‚Äôll:

1. Ensure the cluster is running
2. (If not already done) `zarf init`
3. `zarf package deploy` the file ‚Äî **with Wi‚ÄëFi off**
4. Port‚Äëforward to the service and browse the app

---

## Phase 1 (Connected): Create the package
Create a working directory:

```bash
mkdir -p zarf-podinfo-demo && cd zarf-podinfo-demo
```

Create a `zarf.yaml` describing the package:

```yaml
# zarf.yaml
apiVersion: zarf.dev/v1alpha1
kind: ZarfPackage
metadata:
  name: podinfo-demo
  description: Offline demo of podinfo packaged by Zarf
  version: 1.0.0
components:
  - name: podinfo
    description: Deploy podinfo via Helm, completely offline
    required: true
    charts:
      - name: podinfo
        # Lock to the exact chart version you tested
        version: "<PODINFO_CHART_VERSION>"      # e.g., "6.5.4"
        namespace: demo
        releaseName: podinfo
        # Use the OCI location so Zarf vendors the chart into the package
        url: oci://ghcr.io/stefanprodan/podinfo-chart
        valuesFiles:
          - values.yaml
    # Explicitly list images so they are pulled into the package
    images:
      - ghcr.io/stefanprodan/podinfo:<PODINFO_IMAGE_TAG>  # e.g., "6.5.4"
```

Create a minimal `values.yaml` to customize the demo:

```yaml
# values.yaml
replicaCount: 1
ui:
  message: "Hello from Zarf ‚Äî no internet required!"
```

> üí° The chart and image versions don‚Äôt have to match numerically, but **must** exist. Pin them to an exact version you‚Äôve tested to ensure reproducibility.

Now create the package (this step downloads artifacts and embeds them):

```bash
zarf package create . --confirm
```

You should now have a file similar to:

```
zarf-package-podinfo-demo-1.0.0-amd64.tar.zst
```

Optionally verify what‚Äôs inside:

```bash
zarf package inspect zarf-package-podinfo-demo-1.0.0-amd64.tar.zst
```

Copy the package file to your demo laptop (USB, etc.).

---

## Phase 2 (Once per cluster): Initialize Zarf
On the demo machine **with the target cluster running**, initialize Zarf. This installs the Zarf system components (including the internal registry) into the cluster so deployments can load packaged images without the public internet.

```bash
zarf init --confirm
```

> ‚úÖ Do this only once per cluster. For fresh ephemeral clusters (kind/k3d/minikube), run it after the cluster is created.

---

## Phase 3 (Disconnected): Deploy the package
Turn off Wi‚ÄëFi to prove the point. Then deploy:

```bash
zarf package deploy ./zarf-package-podinfo-demo-1.0.0-amd64.tar.zst --confirm
```

Watch the pods come up:

```bash
kubectl get pods -n demo -w
```

When `podinfo` is `Running`, port‚Äëforward and open your browser:

```bash
kubectl port-forward -n demo svc/podinfo 8080:80
```

Visit <http://localhost:8080> ‚Äî you should see the UI message from `values.yaml`.

---

## Live demo flow (suggested script)
1. **Show the package**: a single `.tar.zst` file on your desktop.
2. **Toggle airplane mode**: visibly disable networking.
3. **`zarf package deploy`**: audience can see images loading from the in‚Äëcluster registry.
4. **Port‚Äëforward & refresh**: open the app UI; call out the custom message.
5. **Q&A**: highlight that Helm and image pulls were satisfied locally; no external registries or repos were contacted.

---

## Cleanup
When you‚Äôre done:

```bash
zarf package remove podinfo-demo --confirm
```

> If your talk uses a throwaway cluster, you can also delete the cluster entirely and skip `zarf package remove`.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Image not found during create**: double‚Äëcheck `images:` tags exist and are reachable from the build machine.
- **Chart fetch fails during create**: verify the OCI URL and chart `version`. Zarf vendors the chart into the package; it will not contact the chart repo at deploy time.
- **No pods after deploy**: did you run `zarf init` on this cluster? Run `zarf init --confirm` once, then redeploy.
- **Port‚Äëforwarding hangs**: ensure the service name is `podinfo` in namespace `demo`. Use `kubectl get svc -n demo` to confirm.

---

## Reuse & extensions
- **Workshops:** hand out the same `.tar.zst` file to attendees; they can deploy without internet as long as their cluster is initialized with Zarf.
- **Multiple apps:** add more components to the same `zarf.yaml` (each with charts/images) to build a single multi‚Äëapp demo bundle.
- **Ingress:** if your venue provides a local network, set up an ingress in `values.yaml` for friendlier URLs.

## Appendix B ‚Äî Offline readiness checklist
- [ ] `zarf package create` succeeds on a connected build machine
- [ ] `zarf package inspect` lists the expected images and the podinfo chart
- [ ] Package file copied to demo machine
- [ ] Demo cluster created and `zarf init --confirm` has been run once
- [ ] Optional: test deploy with Wi‚ÄëFi off ahead of the talk

## Rationale for docs site
Conference organizers often advise against live demos due to network instability. This tutorial demonstrates how Zarf **eliminates that risk** by packaging all dependencies ahead of time. Speakers can confidently deliver real, hands‚Äëon demos that work everywhere‚Äîfrom a hotel ballroom to a classified lab‚Äîwithout internet access.
