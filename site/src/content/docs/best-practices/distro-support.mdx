title: "Distro support"
---

Zarf supports:

- Kind - Works
- K3d - Works
- Minikube - Works
- K3s - Works, builtin support
- Talos - works only in `--registry-proxy` mode and requires `kubectl label namespace zarf pod-security.kubernetes.io/enforce=privileged --overwrite` to get over the default security for `hostport` or `hostNetwork` on IPV6. Apply the configmap in the talos folder with `kustomize build | kubectl apply -f -` and apply the patch with `talosctl patch mc --nodes <node-ip> --patch @talos-patch.yaml`


From document on registry proxy
Practical risks:
- Some distros may disallow this
  - Kind - works
  - K3D - works
  - microk8s - works
  - talos - works, but needs to make the Zarf namespace privileged
  - k0s - almost certainly works, but I need to get PVCs working on it to test 100%
  - k3s - works
  - RKE2 - works
  - OpenShift - HostNetwork works, but hostPort does not. Requires `oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z default -n zarf` to allow hostNetwork to work.
- Some CNIs may disallow host network or host port
  - flannel - works
  - calico - works
