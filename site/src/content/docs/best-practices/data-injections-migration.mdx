title: "Migrate off of Data injections"
---

This guide explains how to migrate your Zarf deployment from the data injections feature to OCI image-based data delivery methods. Data injections are deprecated in the current Zarf schema version amd will be fully removed in the next schema version. There are several reasons behind this:

- **Poor User Experience**: Many users have struggled to figure out how to adopt data injections.
- **Host dependency**: Data injections shells out to `tar`. This makes testing difficult and introduces differences across environments.
- **Better alternatives**: OCI images provide a Kubernetes native solution for data delivery, and neatly fit into the Zarf delivery paradigm.

## Migration guide

### Step 1: Package Your Data in an OCI Image

First, create a container image containing your data:

```dockerfile
FROM alpine:3.18
COPY your-data-file /your-data/your-data-file
```

Build and push this image:
```bash
docker build -t your-registry/your-data:tag .
docker push your-registry/your-data:tag
```

:::tip

Some registries will not accept images over a certain size or you may want to avoid pushing your data to a connected registry. To build the package with a local image use [Image Archives](/ref/components#container-image-archives).

### Step 2: Update zarf.yaml

**Before (Data Injections):**
```yaml
kind: ZarfPackageConfig
metadata:
  name: data-injections
components:
  - name: my-app
    required: true
    images:
      - ghcr.io/my-app:1.0.0
      - alpine:3.18
    dataInjections:
      - source: my-folder
        target:
          namespace: my-app
          selector: app=my-app
          container: data-loader
          path: /data
        compress: true
```

**After (Init Container Strategy):**
```yaml
kind: ZarfPackageConfig
metadata:
  name: init-data-loading
components:
  - name: my-app
    required: true
    images:
      - ghcr.io/my-app:1.0.0
      - your-registry/your-data:tag  # Your container with your data file
```

**Key Changes:**
- Remove `dataInjections` section entirely.
- Replace the init container image, alpine:3.18, used during data injections with the data image.

### Step 3: Update Deployment Manifest

**Before (Data Injections):**
```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      initContainers:
        - name: data-loader
          image: alpine:3.18
          command: ["sh", "-c"]
          args:
            - 'while [ ! -f /data/###ZARF_DATA_INJECTION_MARKER### ]; do echo "waiting for zarf data sync" && sleep 1; done; echo "we are done waiting!"'
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /data
              name: data
```

**After (Init Container Strategy):**
```yaml
spec:
  template:
    spec:
      initContainers:
        - name: data-puller
          image: your-registry/your-data:tag
          command: ["sh", "-c"]
          args:
            - |
              cp /your-data/your-data-file /data/my-app-data-location
              ls -la /data
              echo "Data initialization complete"
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /data
              name: data
```

**Key Changes:**
- Replace data injection marker waiting logic with direct data copying.
- Use your data container image.

Your app should be ready to deploy. If there are any reasons that this method does not work for you, please comment in issue [#3926](https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/issues/3926)

## Future Alternatives

The Kubernetes feature [OCI volume sources](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/tree/master/keps/sig-node/4639-oci-volume-source) is considered stable as of 1.35. Once this feature is supported by Zarf, [#3235](https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/pull/3235), this document will recommend that method. OCI volumes sources provide a simple way to mount data from an image into a pod.
