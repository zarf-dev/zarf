## Homebrew

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is a package manager for macOS and Linux. You can install Zarf with Homebrew by running the following:

```bash
brew tap defenseunicorns/tap && brew install zarf
```

## GitHub Releases

All [Zarf releases](https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/releases) on GitHub include prebuilt binaries that you can download and use. We offer range of combinations of OS and architecture for you to choose from.

export const downloadScript = (os, arch) => `
ZARF_VERSION=$(curl -sIX HEAD https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/releases/latest | grep -i ^location: | grep -Eo 'v[0-9]+.[0-9]+.[0-9]+')

curl -sL "https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/releases/download/\${ZARF_VERSION}/zarf_\${ZARF_VERSION}_${os}_${arch}" -o zarf
chmod +x zarf
`

### Linux

To download Zarf on Linux you can run the following (replacing `$ZARF_VERSION` with any release version of Zarf):

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="x86-64">
<Code code={downloadScript("Linux", "amd64")} lang="bash" />
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="ARM64">
<Code code={downloadScript("Linux", "arm64")} lang="bash" />
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

On most Linux distributions, install the binary onto your `$PATH` by moving the downloaded binary to the `/usr/local/bin` directory:

```bash
sudo mv zarf /usr/local/bin/zarf
```

### macOS

To download Zarf on macOS you can run the following (replacing `$ZARF_VERSION` with any release version of Zarf):

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Intel">
<Code code={downloadScript("Darwin", "amd64")} lang="zsh" />
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Apple Silicon">
<Code code={downloadScript("Darwin", "arm64")} lang="zsh" />
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Install the binary onto your `$PATH` by moving the downloaded binary to the `/usr/local/bin` directory:

```bash
sudo mv zarf /usr/local/bin/zarf
```

### Windows

To download Zarf on Windows you can run the following (replacing `$ZarfVersion` with any release version of Zarf):

export const downloadPowerShellScript = (arch) => `
$ZarfVersion = (Invoke-RestMethod https://api.github.com/repos/zarf-dev/zarf/releases/latest).tag_name

Start-BitsTransfer -Source "https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/releases/download/$($ZarfVersion)/zarf_$($ZarfVersion)_Windows_${arch}.exe" -Destination zarf.exe
`

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="x86-64">
<Code code={downloadPowerShellScript("amd64")} lang="powershell" />
</TabItem>
<TabItem label="ARM64">
<Code code={downloadPowerShellScript("arm64")} lang="powershell" />
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

You can also install the binary onto your `$PATH` by moving the downloaded binary to the desired directory and modifying the `$PATH` environment variable to include that directory.

## Community

The following are unofficial methods of installing Zarf that are maintained by the community:

- `apk add` on [Alpine Linux Edge](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/package/edge/testing/x86_64/zarf)
- `asdf install` with the [ASDF Version Manager](https://github.com/defenseunicorns-labs/asdf-zarf)
- `nix-shell`/`nix-env` with [Nix Packages](https://search.nixos.org/packages?channel=23.05&show=zarf&from=0&size=50&sort=relevance&type=packages&query=zarf)
- `pkgx install` with [pkgx](https://pkgx.dev/pkgs/zarf.dev/)

## Building from Source

If you want to build the CLI from scratch, you can do that too. Our local builds depend on [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) and [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf
cd zarf
# build the CLI for your current OS and architecture
make

# see all available make targets
make help
```

## Post-Install Steps

### Checking the Zarf Version

Once you have installed Zarf with one of the above methods, you can verify it is working with the following:

```bash
$ zarf version

vX.X.X  # X.X.X is replaced with the version number of your specific installation
```

:::note

If you are not seeing this then Zarf was not installed onto your `$PATH` correctly. [This $PATH guide](https://zwbetz.com/how-to-add-a-binary-to-your-path-on-macos-linux-windows/) should help with that.

### Obtaining an 'init' Package

```bash
# if no init package is detected, zarf will prompt you to download the default one on init
$ zarf init

# if you want to download the init package without being prompted
$ zarf tools download-init
$ zarf init --confirm
```

The default 'init' package can also be obtained by visiting the [Zarf releases](https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/releases) page and downloading it into your working directory or into `~/.zarf-cache/zarf-init-<amd64|arm64>-vX.X.X.tar.zst`.

:::tip

You can build your own custom 'init' package too if you'd like. For this you should check out the [Creating a Custom 'init' Package Tutorial](/tutorials/7-custom-init-packages).
