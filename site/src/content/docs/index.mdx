Zarf is a free and open-source tool that enables _**declarative creation & distribution of software into air-gapped/constrained/standalone environments**_.

Zarf provides a way to package and deploy software in a way that is **repeatable**, **secure**, and **reliable**.

## Why Use Zarf?

- üí∏ **Free and Open-Source.** Zarf will always be free to use and maintained by the open-source community.
- ‚≠êÔ∏è **Zero Dependencies.** As a statically compiled binary, the Zarf CLI has zero dependencies to run on any machine.
- üîì **No Vendor Lock.** There is no proprietary software that locks you into using Zarf. If you want to remove it, you still can use your helm charts to deploy your software manually.
- üíª **OS Agnostic.** Zarf supports numerous operating systems. A full matrix of supported OSes, architectures and featuresets is coming soon.
- üì¶ **Highly Distributable.** Integrate and deploy software from multiple secure development environments including edge, embedded systems, secure cloud, data centers, and even local environments.
- üöÄ **Develop Connected, Deploy Disconnected.** Teams can build and configure individual applications or entire DevSecOps environments while connected to the internet. Once created, they can be packaged and shipped to a disconnected environment to be deployed.
- üíø **Single File Deployments.** Zarf allows you to package the parts of the internet your app needs into a single compressed file to be installed without connectivity.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Declarative Deployments.** Zarf packages define the precise state for your application enabling it to be deployed the same way every time.
- ü¶ñ **Inherit Legacy Code.** Zarf packages can wrap legacy code and projects - allowing them to be deployed to modern DevSecOps environments.
