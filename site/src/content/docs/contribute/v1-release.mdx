title: v1.0.0 Release Plan
---

## 1. Overview

**Milestone:** [v1.0.0 Release](https://github.com/zarf-dev/zarf/milestone/59)
**Project Board:** [v1.0.0 Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/zarf-dev/projects/1/views/7)

The v1.0.0 release of **Zarf** represents the first **production-ready**, **stable API** version of the project, designed for reliable use in **air-gapped**, **semi-connected**, and **connected** environments.
This release will focus on **stability, core feature completeness, and ease of adoption** for both end-users and integrators.

The purpose of this document and all associated references are to create an open and inclusive progression towards the `v1.0.0` release and used to justify work that affects the release accordingly.

---

## 2. Project Goals

- Deliver a stable, tested, and documented set of **core Zarf features** that will remain backward-compatible within the 1.x lifecycle.
- Provide **robust installation, packaging, and deployment workflows** for air-gapped Kubernetes environments.
- Offer a **clear upgrade path** from pre-v1.0.0 versions.
- Ship with **documentation and tutorials** that enable first-time success without deep prior expertise.
- Integrate **CI/CD automation** for consistent build and release processes.

---

## 3. Non-Goals

- Experimental features that have not undergone sufficient field testing.
- Major architectural changes that would destabilize the release timeline.
- Support for environments outside of the defined initial scope (e.g., non-Kubernetes orchestration).
- Large-scale refactors unrelated to core release goals.

---

## 4. In-Scope Features for v1.0.0

**Core Features:**
1. **Zarf Package Management**
   - Creation, signing, and verification of Zarf packages.
   - Air-gapped deployment support.
2. **Cluster Bootstrap**
   - Reliable, repeatable cluster bootstrapping in disconnected environments.
3. **Artifact Handling**
   - Image management, registry population, and artifact caching.
4. **CLI Stability**
   - Finalized command structure and consistent flags/options.
5. **Logging and Diagnostics**
   - Clear, actionable, and auditable logging for troubleshooting.

**Quality & Reliability:**
- Automated test coverage for core workflows.
- End-to-end testing in multiple deployment scenarios (connected, semi-connected, air-gapped).
- Performance benchmarks for common workflows.

**Documentation:**
- Install guides for different connectivity modes.
- Tutorials for package creation and deployment.
- API and CLI reference documentation.

## 5. Pre-v1.0.0 Development

These items are not "features" of V1, but are considered critical issues to be delivered before the v1.0.0 release and effect the schedule accordingly:

- CI/CD pipeline reliability improvements.
- Security audit and remediation of any high/critical findings.
- Documentation build pipeline finalized.
- Dependency updates for long-term support stability.

---

## 6. Out of Scope for v1.0.0

- Plugin system for third-party extensions.
- Major UI/UX rework beyond existing CLI enhancements.
- Experimental integrations with emerging projects.

## 7. Milestones & Timeline

These dates are not estimates. This table offers historical visibility around the progress through key milestones.

| Milestone / Phase                | Target Date     | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Scope Finalization               | YYYY-MM-DD      | v1.0.0 feature set, non-goals, and blockers.                              |
| Feature Completion.              | YYYY-MM-DD      | All in-scope features implemented; only bug fixes and docs updates remain. |
| Docs & Release Prep              | YYYY-MM-DD      | Documentation finalized, release candidate built.                          |
| V1 Release                       | YYYY-MM-DD      | Public release with announcement and changelog.                            |

## 9. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk                                                        | Mitigation                                                                       |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Pre-v1.0.0 blockers take longer than expected                | Track separately and escalate during weekly release reviews.                    |
| Scope creep                                                  | Enforce scope freeze; move non-essential items to post-v1.0.0 milestone.        |
| External dependency delays                                   | Identify early; build contingency plans for affected functionality.             |
