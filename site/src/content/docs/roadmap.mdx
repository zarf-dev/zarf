title: Zarf 2025 Roadmap
---

## Introduction

2025 is about building resilience, empowering extensibility, and preparing the system for broader integrations through SDKs.

## Core Themes for 2025

- **SDK Support & Decoupled Architecture**
  Enable integration and extensibility by refactoring the core to cleanly separate CLI operations from library logic. This will unlock use cases for tooling integration, programmatic workflows, and community enhancements.

- **Resilient-by-Design Infrastructure**
  Invest in the internal consistency, recovery, and upgrade mechanisms of Zarf to ensure performance across edge and connected environments.

- **Operational Enhancements**
  Improve package lifecycle operations, diagnostics, and user observability to make Zarf more usable and reliable in production.

- **Workflow Stability & Expansion**
  Mature the current package lifecycle, extend schema-based definitions, and reduce the learning curve for new users through simplification and documentation.

## 2025 Development Story

### SDK Readiness (Q1 - Q2)

We began the year with a deliberate push to lay the groundwork for SDK support. This involves:

- Refactoring internal logic to split the CLI from the shared library.
- Establishing SDK entry points for Zarf functionality.
- Introducing shared serialization and validation tooling to enable custom tooling built on Zarf.

Parallel to these efforts, we also focused on extending our test suite to cover decoupled components and ensure changes did not regress GA stability.

### Hardening & Observability (Q2 - Q3)

As the architecture matured, attention turns to reliability and transparency:

- Added in-depth error messages and diagnostic metadata to simplify user troubleshooting.
- Hardened lifecycle to recover from partial failures or restarts.
- Standardize on logging patterns for package lifecycle execution.

These upgrades strengthen Zarf's use in production pipelines and across disconnected systems.

### Package Lifecycle and UX Enhancements (Q3 - Q4)

Actively investing in enhancements that simplify and expand what Zarf can do:

- Simplified authoring of `zarf.yaml` with clearer validation errors and editor integrations.
- Improved support for chaining packages and dynamic variable injection during deploy.
- Enhance chart values patterns and enhance configuration opportunities.

We believe these improvements can assist in making zarf more operationally effective.

### Community, Contribution & Ecosystem (Ongoing)

Throughout the year, the Zarf team remains committed to open governance and community development:

- Bi-weekly community meetups to showcase demos and field feature proposals.
- RFC-based feature discussion process introduced to align internal and external contributors.
- Continued engagement with the OpenSSF Incubation process and secure software practices.
- Creation and maintenance of learning materials.

## Feature Stability Guidance

We continue to follow the [Kubernetes feature maturity model](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/#api-versioning) for Zarf features:

- **Alpha**: Experimental, subject to change/removal.
- **Beta**: Functionally complete but still evolving; documented with known caveats.
- **Stable**: Guaranteed backwards compatibility, robust documentation and testing.
- **Deprecated**: Marked for removal, with alternatives documented.
