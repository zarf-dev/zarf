title: Zarf 2026 Roadmap
---

## Introduction

2026 is about building long-term sustainability, provenance, and enhancing the package lifecycle from creation through deployment with enhanced state.

## Development Story

### Sustainability and Provenance (Q1 - Q2)

Support the advancement of the project with schema updates, new features, and required deprecations/removals. Additionally establishing parity with the signing and verification ecosystem that aligns natively to the airgapped environments through offline verification:

- Introduce next schema version, improve structure, and identify deprecations removals
- Zarf Package Signing and Verification Enhancements
- Enhance values patterns to improve configuration user experience and migration
- Extend, validate, and document Zarf's support across different Kubernetes distributions.

These allow the project to iterate towards a sustainable baseline that can be supported once v1.0.0 is reached.

### Operations and Security (Q2 - Q3)

As the architecture matures, package creation should establish transparency and security, as well as improving state management:

- SBOM packaging, management, and publishing
- Package creation security verification enhancements
- Improve state management to enable more dynamic deployment scenarios and ensure resource traceability.
- Security and Threat Model enhancements (mTLS for Zarf infrastructure)

These improvements provide greater trust to the packaging process and allow greater control of how deployed operations occur.

### Package and Infrastructure adaptability (Q3 - Q4)

Actively investing in enhancements that simplify and expand what Zarf can do:

- Package maintainability, Improve component imports, YOLO package support
- Builtin Support for multi-architecture clusters
- Package resource evaluation and optimization

We believe these improvements can assist in making zarf more operationally effective.

### Community, Contribution & Ecosystem (Ongoing)

Throughout the year, the Zarf team remains committed to open governance and community development:

- Bi-weekly community [meetups](https://zoom-lfx.platform.linuxfoundation.org/meeting/97461829237?password=add48ad5-fc07-4951-96d2-531b72d2a5dc) to showcase demos and field feature proposals.
- [Zarf Enhancements Proposal](https://github.com/zarf-dev/proposals) process to align contributors and consumers of proposed features or changes.
- Continued engagement with the OpenSSF Incubation process and secure software practices.
- Broader support and Documentation for Kubernetes Distribution operations.
- Creation and maintenance of learning and community materials.
- Improve sustainability and governance of the project.
- Respond to Critical bug fixes and vulnerabilities.

## Feature Stability Guidance

Our feature lifecycle is defined as follows:

- **Alpha**: Experimental, subject to change/removal.
- **Beta**: Functionally complete but still evolving; documented with known caveats.
- **Stable**: Guaranteed backwards compatibility, robust documentation and testing.
- **Deprecated**: Marked for removal, with alternatives documented.
