# Adopters

Below is a list of organizations and users who have publicly shared that
they're using Zarf in production environments.

The purpose of this list is to inspire others to join the movement and help
grow our open-source community and project. Documented adoption helps influence
project health and evaluation for the OpenSSF [project lifecycle](https://github.com/ossf/tac/blob/main/process/project-lifecycle.md).

Adding your organization takes just 5 minutes of your time, but it means a lot
to us!
