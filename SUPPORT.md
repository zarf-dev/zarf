# Support Guidelines

We strive to create clear guidelines on communication to the Zarf team to provide a good community experience.

## Questions
For guidance on using Zarf, [the documentation](https://docs.zarf.dev/) should cover most use cases.
For all questions documentation may not cover, we suggest utilizing [Github Discussions](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/discussions).

## Standard Process
All code issues should be a [Github Issue](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues/new/choose) that follows the issue template. 

Following the templates provides the Zarf community a foundation of understanding to be able to assist quickly.
After an issue is made, this issue can be brought into other channels such as the [Kubernetes Slack #Zarf](https://zarf.dev/slack) channel or the [bi-weekly Zarf Community Meeting](https://docs.zarf.dev/contribute/contributor-guide/).

## Sensitive Information Process
For issues from those who are unable to post on Github, you may send an email using the following issue template filled out to [zarf-dev-private@googlegroups.com](zarf-dev-private@googlegroups.com)

The response time to emails may be delayed  as they are not able to receive community help, so we encourage participation into Github Issues as much as possible.
