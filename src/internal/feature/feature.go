// Atoms wrapping the default and user-set collections of Features. These do not require mutexes because they will each
// be modified very few times, with the public API for each ensuring that only an empty set can be written to.
// Alternatively these could be sync.Maps but they're not written to enough where it matters.
// e.g. These atoms are write once, ready many (WORM).

// Name describes the canonical identifier for the feature. It must be globally unique across all features for the full
// lifespan of the Zarf project. Once created, names are considered immutable and may not be removed or redacted. Should
// a feature evolve enough to require renaming, then a new feature can be created and the original marked as Deprecated.
// The Deprecated feature's Description should provide context (like the ZEP or ADR) and point users to the new feature.
type Name string

// Description is an explanation of the feature, what to expect when it's enabled or disabled, the associated proposal,
// and any commentary or context appropriate for its stage. Descirptions are mutable, and are intended to be updated
// throughout the feature's development lifecycle.
type Description string

// Enabled describes the state of the feature. In cases where the Default feature state and User feature states do not
// match, User feature state takes precedence.
type Enabled bool

// Since marks the Zarf version that a feature is first released in Alpha. By convention Since is semver starting with
// "v": "v1.0.0".
type Since string

// Until marks the intended Zarf version that a Deprecated feature will or has been fully removed. If Deprecation must
// be delayed, then this version be updated. By convention Until is semver starting with "v": "v1.0.0".
