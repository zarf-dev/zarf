# Core Concepts

Now, assuming you're familiar with Kubernetes, AirGap, and GitOps from [Understanding the Basics](../1-getting-started/0-understand-the-basics.md), we can get started on the core concepts of Zarf.

## Zarf Concepts

- [**Zarf Package**](../3-create-a-zarf-package/1-zarf-packages.md) - A binary file that contains the instructions and dependencies necessary to install an application on a system.
- [**Zarf Component**](../3-create-a-zarf-package/2-zarf-components.md) - A set of defined functionality and resources that build up a package.
- [**Zarf Init Package**](../3-create-a-zarf-package/3-the-zarf-init-package.md) - The initial package that lays the groundwork for other packages.
