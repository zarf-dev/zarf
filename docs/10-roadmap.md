## Roadmap
The project roadmap for Zarf is hosted on a [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/orgs/defenseunicorns/projects/1). There, you can see what we're working on and what work we're prioritizing.

If you want to add your own bug reports or feature requests to be considered on our roadmap, please feel free [add an issue](https://github.com/defenseunicorns/zarf/issues) on the GitHub repository.

## GA Release
Right now, Zarf is still in its 'beta' phase. We are working on a few final things before we release the official 1.0 general availability (GA) release. The current planned date for the GA release is mid June 2022. The work still needed for the GA release can be found on the roadmap with [this filter](https://github.com/orgs/defenseunicorns/projects/1/views/1?filterQuery=repo%3A%22defenseunicorns%2Fzarf%22+milestone%3A%22zarf+ga%22).
