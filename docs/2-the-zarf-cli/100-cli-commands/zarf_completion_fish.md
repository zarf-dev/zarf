<!-- Auto-generated by hack/gen-cli-docs.sh -->

Generate the autocompletion script for fish

## Synopsis

Generate the autocompletion script for the fish shell.

To load completions in your current shell session:

	zarf completion fish | source

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

	zarf completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/zarf.fish

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.


```
zarf completion fish [flags]
```

## Options

```
  -h, --help              help for fish
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
```

  -a, --architecture string   Architecture for OCI images and Zarf packages
      --insecure              Allow access to insecure registries and disable other recommended security enforcements such as package checksum and signature validation. This flag should only be used if you have a specific reason and accept the reduced security posture.
