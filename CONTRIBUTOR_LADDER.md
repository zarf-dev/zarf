Nominate by opening a PR against the Zarf repository, which adds their GitHub username to the OWNERS file for one or more directories.
Two maintainers must approve the PR.

## Inactive members
A core principle in maintaining a healthy community is encouraging active participation.
It is inevitable that a contributor's focus will change over time
and there is no expectation they'll actively contribute forever.

Any contributor at any level described above may write an issue (or pull request, if CODEOWNER changes are necessary)
asking to step down to a lighter-weight tier or to depart the project entirely.
Such requests will hopefully come after thoughtful conversations with the rest of the team
and with sufficient forewarning for the others to prepare. However, sometimes "life happens".
Therefore, the change in responsibilities will be understood to take immediate effect,
regardless of whether the issue/PR has been acknowledged or merged.

However, should a Reviewer or above be deemed inactive for a significant period, any
Contributor or above may write an issue/pull request requesting their removal from the ranks
(and `@mentioning` the inactive contributor in the hopes of drawing their attention).
The request must receive support (in comments) from a majority of Maintainers to proceed.
