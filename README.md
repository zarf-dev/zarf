Zarf eliminates the [complexity of airgap software delivery](https://www.itopstimes.com/contain/air-gap-kubernetes-considerations-for-running-cloud-native-applications-without-the-cloud/) for Kubernetes clusters and cloud-native workloads using a declarative packaging strategy to support DevSecOps in offline and semi-connected environments.

## Why Use Zarf

- üí∏ **Free and Open-Source.** Zarf will always be free to use and maintained by the open-source community.
- ‚≠êÔ∏è **Zero Dependencies.** As a statically compiled binary, the Zarf CLI has zero dependencies to run on any machine.
- üîì **No Vendor Lock.** There is no proprietary software that locks you into using Zarf. If you want to remove it, you can still use your Helm charts to deploy your software manually.
- üíª **OS Agnostic.** Zarf supports numerous operating systems. A full matrix of supported OSes, architectures, and feature sets is coming soon.
- üì¶ **Highly Distributable.** Integrate and deploy software from multiple secure development environments, including edge, embedded systems, secure cloud, data centers, and even local environments.
- üöÄ **Develop Connected, Deploy Disconnected.** Teams can build and configure individual applications or entire DevSecOps environments while connected to the internet. Once created, they can be packaged and shipped to a disconnected environment to be deployed.
- üíø **Single File Deployments.** Zarf allows you to package the parts of the internet your app needs into a single compressed file to be installed without connectivity.
- ‚ôªÔ∏è **Declarative Deployments.** Zarf packages define the precise state for your application, enabling it to be deployed the same way every time.
- ü¶ñ **Inherit Legacy Code.** Zarf packages can wrap legacy code and projects - allowing them to be deployed to modern DevSecOps environments.

## üì¶ Out of the Box Features

- Automate Kubernetes deployments in disconnected environments
- Automate [Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)](https://docs.zarf.dev/ref/sboms/) generation
- Build and [publish packages as OCI image artifacts](https://docs.zarf.dev/tutorials/6-publish-and-deploy/)
